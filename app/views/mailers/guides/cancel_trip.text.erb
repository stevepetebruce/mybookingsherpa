Cancel <%= @trip.name %>, <%= "#{@trip.start_date.day} - #{@trip.end_date.day} #{Date::MONTHNAMES[@trip.end_date.month]} #{@trip.end_date.year}" %>?
===============================================

Hi <%= @guide.name %>,

There aren't enough guests for <%= @trip.name %> and you will need to decide if you want to cancel the trip and refund all guests' deposits. There's currently <%= @trip.guest_count %> booked on the trip.

If you want to cancel the trip, you will need to contact the guests yourself to let them know that the trip is cancelled and discuss refunds.

If you have questions please contact: support@mybookingsherpa.com


Thank you from all at the MyBookingSherpa team.

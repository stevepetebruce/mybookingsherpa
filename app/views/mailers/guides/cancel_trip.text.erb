Cancel <%= @trip.name %>, <%= "#{@trip.start_date.day} - #{@trip.end_date.day} #{Date::MONTHNAMES[@trip.end_date.month]} #{@trip.end_date.year}" %>?
===============================================

Hi <%= @guide.name %>,

There isn't enough guests for <%= @trip.name %> and you will need to decide if you want to cancel the trip and refund all guests' deposits. There's currently <%= @trip.guest_count %> booked on the trip.

If you want to refund all the deposits and cancel the trip, just reply to this email letting us know and we can start the refund process.

You will need to contact the guests yourself to let them know that the trip is cancelled.

If you have questions please contact: support@mybookingsherpa.com


Thank you from all at the MyBookingSherpa team.

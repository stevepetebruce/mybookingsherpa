===============================================

Hi <%= @booking.guide_name %>,

Good news.

You've received a new booking from <%= @booking.guest_or_booking_name %> for <%= @booking.trip_name %>.

<%= link_to guides_trips_url, "Click here" %> to see <%= @booking.trip_name %> status and <%= link_to guides_booking_url(@booking), "click here" %> to see <%= @booking.guest_or_booking_name %>'s details.

They have successfully been charged <%= "#{Currency.iso_to_symbol(@booking.currency)}#{Currency.human_readable(@booking.last_payment.amount)}" %> and you should see this (minus handling fee) within two working days.

If this was a deposit payment, then the remainder will be automatically collected later and paid into your account. If the trip is cancelled, then this deposit will automatically be refunded to the guest.

We have emailed the guest your contact details. Please email them the itinerary of the trip.

If you have questions please contact: support@mybookingsherpa.com


Thank you from all at the MyBookingSherpa team.

      # At some point this will need to know

      # or the full payment. Will need to create
      # a customer for this, ie: to make one charge
      # now (deposit) and another full amount later.
      # Ref: https://stripe.com/docs/saving-cards
      # Then once the full payment has been made - delete the usersâ€™ card data
      # Safest thing to do here.
      # TODO: Need to be careful if we ever handle JPY (a zero-decimal currency)
